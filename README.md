# Recruitment dashboard code which is publicly viewable
Over the course of my internship I created the new dashboard based on the existing infrastructure, most of which is a company secret, so to speak. In order for my assessors to view said code, I have extracted most of the parts written by me.

Most of the code won't make much sense in this context, but it's the most I could do.

I assure you, this is not how I normally publish or manage my code bases, this is a weird situation in which I have to balance the company policies and the universities' needs.
